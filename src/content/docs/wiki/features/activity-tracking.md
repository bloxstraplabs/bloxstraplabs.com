title: Activity tracking
---

Activity tracking is a component of Bloxstrap that lets it run in the background and detect what game you're playing.

This feature serves as the basis for a few other features:
- [Discord Rich Presence](/wiki/features/discord-rich-presence/)
- [Server location hints](/wiki/features/server-location-hints/)
- [Game history](/wiki/features/game-history/)

To use these features, activity tracking will need to be enabled.

When it's enabled, Bloxstrap will stay running in the background while you're playing, and it'll show in your system tray. Right-clicking on the tray icon will bring up a menu where you can use its features.

Clicking 'Copy invite deeplink' will copy a shareable invite link for your server to your clipboard. This link can be used by anyone with Roblox installed, even players who don't have Bloxstrap.

Some options may not be shown if you're not currently in a game.
