title: Don't exit to Desktop app

:::note
This feature requires [activity tracking](/wiki/features/activity-tracking/) to be enabled.
:::

When this feature is enabled, Roblox will fully close when you leave a game instead of dropping you back into the app, much like how it used to work before 2022.

:::caution
This will break certain features that rely on the app to work.

You won't be able to accept in-game player invites, for example.
