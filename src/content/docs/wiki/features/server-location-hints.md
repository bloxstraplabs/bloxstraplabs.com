title: Server location hints

:::note
This feature requires [activity tracking](/wiki/features/activity-tracking/) to be enabled.

This feature is also referred to as 'Server location querying' in some places.
:::

When you join a server, Bloxstrap can roughly determine where the server is located, and tell you about it. Currently, our provider for this information is [ipinfo.io](https://ipinfo.io).

This info can be useful when, for example, serverhopping for an optimal server (though this won't work if you join games too quickly).

Typically it will give you a system notification when you join, like this:

If you didn't see the notification, you can see the info by opening the [activity tracker](/wiki/features/activity-tracking/) menu and choosing the 'Server information' option.
