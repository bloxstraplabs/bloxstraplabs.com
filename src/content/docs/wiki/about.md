title: What is Bloxstrap?
---

Bloxstrap is an alternative bootstrapper (a.k.a. launcher) for Roblox that aims to enhance the Roblox experience with additional useful features and functions. 

It has a small but valuable feature set, and you can see the Features section on the side for more information about them.

It's also free and [open-source on GitHub](https://github.com/bloxstraplabs/bloxstrap), and anyone can contribute to it. It's developed by Roblox players, for Roblox players.

It works completely cleanly and is not intrusive to the Roblox client. It has nothing to do with exploiting and doesn't behave like an exploit, so you can't get banned for using it.
