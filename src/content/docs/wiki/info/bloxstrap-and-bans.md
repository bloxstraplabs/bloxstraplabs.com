title: Bloxstrap and Bans
description: You can't get banned for using Bloxstrap, and this page explains why.

Bloxstrap is not exploit software, and does not behave like it. It's completely clean. You can't get banned for using it. People who claim they've been banned for using it were actually banned for using exploits.

Roblox is not against players using Bloxstrap and they don't have any reason to be. This fact has been confirmed by Roblox Staff. ([source](https://devforum.roblox.com/t/welcoming-byfron-to-roblox/2018233/693?u=xtremeguy2256))

## What Roblox bans people for and how

There exists software that allows you to hack and cheat in Roblox (most often for executing scripts). These are commonly called 'exploits'.

These work by tampering with the Roblox client process and invasively screwing around in its memory space. Injecting code, hooking and calling on functions, all that kind of stuff.

The Roblox client has cheat detection to detect this stuff and ban people who use these exploits. However, they don't ban them straight away.

Roblox strategically bans people in banwaves. They collect detections overtime, and ban all the detected players at once. Rinse and repeat. It's a common industry strategy to make it harder for exploit developers to tell if they're successfully evading detection.

## What Bloxstrap is and does

Bloxstrap does not touch the Roblox client process whatsoever. It's completely clean and non-invasive. It does not at all behave like exploits do, so none of the detection systems that apply to exploits can apply to Bloxstrap.

What it does touch are local files that the Roblox client uses. For [modding](/wiki/features/modding), it's just stuff like fonts and textures. But this is completely fine, and is all harmless. If anything we were doing here was a security issue, then Roblox could very easily prevent us doing this stuff in the first place.

With Bloxstrap, there isn't anything to detect that would warrant a ban.

Take it from me. I've used Bloxstrap all the time for many years on [my main account](https://www.roblox.com/users/70315552/profile) that's over 10 years old. Never had any bans for game client tampering. It's completely fine.

We also don't have any affiliation with any exploits and never have.

## But this person said they got banned after using Bloxstrap!

So? That doesn't mean anything.

As [mentioned before](#what-roblox-bans-people-for-and-how), Roblox does banwaves for these detections. They don't immediately ban people after they've used an offending piece of software. So you can't correlate this so easily.

For example, it's very possible that they used an exploit a week ago, then used Bloxstrap a week later, and just so happened to get a ban the day after. That doesn't mean Bloxstrap caused it. The exploit did.

Without fail, any person who comes to us claiming that Bloxstrap got them banned also happens to have used exploit software.
