This page details how Bloxstrap handles and exchanges data over the internet.

The privacy policy may change as new versions are released, which the release notes will mention. 

See past versions [here](#) ([old wiki](https://github.com/bloxstraplabs/bloxstrap/wiki/Privacy-Policy/_history)).

## Analytics

By your choice, Bloxstrap may collect analytics. It's very minimal, only as stated here, and completely anonymous.

Here's what we collect and why:
- **Bloxstrap install states.** If you install, uninstall or upgrade Bloxstrap, it gets recorded. It's just for general usage figures.
- **Roblox channel enrollment.** If you're enrolled in a non-production Roblox channel, it'll get recorded. [This data is published publicly.](https://grafana.pizzaboxer.xyz/goto/whOxjg9NR?orgId=1)
- **Bloxstrap exceptions.** If you encounter an error in Bloxstrap then it will be reported to us, along with a log file.

For each data point collected, we also record what version of Bloxstrap you're using.

The system that processes this data is open-source at [github.com/bloxstraplabs/services](https://github.com/bloxstraplabs/services).
