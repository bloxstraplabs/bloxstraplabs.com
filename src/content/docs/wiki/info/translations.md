title: Translations
---

If you're using Bloxstrap in a language other than English and you spot something that's wrong, or you just want to help contribute in general, then you can do so!

All of our translations are [crowdsourced through Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/bloxstrap), and getting involved is as easy as creating a Crowdin account and opening the editor. No application needed or anything, just get straight to it.

To preview translations in context, you can use a tool called [Builder](https://github.com/bloxstraplabs/builder/), which allows you to easily check the newest state of Bloxstrap with up-to-date translations for your language.
