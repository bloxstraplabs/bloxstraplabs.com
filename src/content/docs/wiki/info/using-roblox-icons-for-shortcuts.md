If you want to use Bloxstrap's selection of Roblox icons for your shortcuts, here's how.

First, ensure that you have this option enabled. Be sure you've clicked Save to apply.

Enabling this option will extract the Roblox icons to a folder in Bloxstrap's installation folder. From here, open the properties for your shortcut by right-clicking on it, select "Change Icon", then "Browse...", and then choose the "Icons" folder. Kind of like this:

From here, you can choose an icon to use.
