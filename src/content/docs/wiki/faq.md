## Will using this get me banned?

**Short answer:** No, it won't. We are 100% sure of it, and even [Roblox Staff have confirmed that fact](https://devforum.roblox.com/t/welcoming-byfron-to-roblox/2018233/693?u=xtremeguy2256). Bloxstrap is not exploit software and has nothing to do with exploiting.


**Long answer:** [See here](/wiki/info/bloxstrap-and-bans).

## Where do I get Bloxstrap?

There are only two official places to get it: 
- This website ([bloxstraplabs.com](https://bloxstraplabs.com)) 
- The GitHub repository ([github.com/bloxstraplabs/bloxstrap](https://github.com/bloxstraplabs/bloxstrap))

There are many websites pretending to be us that aren't actually us. We strongly suggest you don't use them, even if they don't appear to be malicious.

## Where can I find mods?

See [here](/wiki/features/modding/#finding-mods-to-use) for where to find mods and how to import them.

## How can I trust that this isn't malware?

Bloxstrap is [fully open-source](https://github.com/bloxstraplabs/bloxstrap), so its code can be seen by anyone. We also have a lot of people looking at our code, since we have a lot of contributors. If there was malicious code, it wouldn't go unnoticed. We're completely clean [on VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/c7f713edb0ccbc992e03546e711ae19a34e5a600fa88e615c5977f31b25cd82d) too.
