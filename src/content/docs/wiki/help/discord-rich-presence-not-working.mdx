title: Discord Rich Presence not working

import { Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Discord Rich Presence requires the Discord desktop app to be installed and running. 

Here are some things to check for to fix the most common problems.

### 1. Discord privacy settings

Check your Discord settings and make sure that your activity is set to be shared with others.

### 2. Administrator issues

Rich Presence will not work if Discord is installed as Administrator. If you see a User Account Control prompt (pictured below) every time you start Discord, then you have it installed as Administrator. 

To fix this, just reinstall Discord.

### 3. Multiple conflicting clients

Discord Rich Presence will only properly work with one Discord client. Ensure you only have one open and running.

### Still not working?

If Discord Rich Presence still is not working, then please [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/bloxstraplabs/bloxstrap/issues).
