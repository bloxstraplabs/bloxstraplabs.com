By default, Bloxstrap works pretty much exactly the same way that the standard Roblox launcher does. So, if Roblox normally works, then using Bloxstrap should work too.

Issues like these are typically caused by bad user configuration (bad fast flags, bad mods, etc).

Here are some general troubleshooting steps to follow:

<Steps>

1. [Uninstall Bloxstrap](/wiki/help/uninstalling-bloxstrap/) **without** keeping user settings

2. Launch Roblox normally, check if it works fine

3. Reinstall Bloxstrap and launch, check if it works fine

4. Add your settings and mods back, checking if Roblox works fine along the way

</Steps>

Ideally, whichever step things last work fine at is how you should keep things.

If Roblox isn't working on a standard install (without Bloxstrap), then you're just out of luck, and Bloxstrap can't really do anything about that. Sorry.
