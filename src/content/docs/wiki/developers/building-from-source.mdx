title: Building from source
---

import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

:::note
The .NET 9 SDK is not yet supported. If you're having issues with building, try uninstalling it and get the [.NET 8 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download) instead.

Also, this can only be done on Windows as this uses the .NET Desktop Runtime.
:::

First, download the source repository using either git clone or GitHub Desktop. Don't download it as a .zip archive as you'll just run into problems when you don't use git.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/bloxstraplabs/bloxstrap.git
cd bloxstrap
git submodule init 
git submodule update
```

From here, you can build using either Visual Studio, or the .NET CLI. If you don't have Visual Studio installed, use the CLI.

  :::note
  These instructions are for building a release binary. Otherwise, you can just use the Visual Studio debugger.
  :::

  Open Bloxstrap.sln in Visual Studio, right-click the Bloxstrap project in the Solution Explorer, and select 'Publish'. Configure your build options if you need to (defaults are fine), and click 'Publish'.

  If you don't have Visual Studio installed, you can just download and install the [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download) for this one.

   Open a Command Prompt window, and set your location to the folder containing Bloxstrap.sln. Then, run the following command:

   ```sh
   dotnet publish Bloxstrap /p:PublishProfile=Publish-x64
   ```

   If you need to configure any build options, run `dotnet help publish` to learn how to configure options for publishing.
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Go to the Bloxstrap folder (the one containing Bloxstrap.csproj), where the artifacts will be located in `bin\Release\net6.0-windows\publish\win-x64`. From there, you can either run and install it fresh, or copy it into your Bloxstrap install location.
